LaTeX templates for several purposes

This repository has some templates of my own and can be use in several
scenarios, mainly in school matter such as reports, notes or list of topics for
some courses. The applications are up to you.

== Usage

In general, you just have to make sure you have the right assets, which are in
this repository and are mainly logos from school or other institution, so can be
replace with yours. Compile it as you may know. I recommend using the litte
script given in this repository (_compile.sh_) since it provides a more
organized structure for your files in compare to some IDEs

If something doesn't display write try a double compilation.

== Screenshots

Here are some screenshots that shows what ca you spect from this templates.

The following subtitles does no force you to use the template for that scenario.
Fell free to use your imagination.

=== Exams template

This template provides and interface to create a teacher and students version of
an exam. The teachers version offers the correct answer and the reference of the
resource from the question taken, as you may see in the picture below.

Check the comments in the source code to know how to use it.
